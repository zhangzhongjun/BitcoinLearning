# 大数溢出漏洞事故（无限造币漏洞）


2010年8月15日，有人在比特币区块链的第74638块上发现了一条让人惊愕的交易，这笔交易里竟然出现了184,467,440,737.09551616个比特币，其中各有922亿个比特币被发送到两个比特币地址。据技术人员分析，黑客是通过利用大整数溢出漏洞，绕过了系统的平衡检查，成功实现了这次攻击。


所幸的是，在发现这一异常现象后的不到半天的时间，比特币核心开发人员就开发完成了比特币补丁版本，并启动了硬分叉，在第74691块，带补丁版本的比特币块链终于追赶上并且超越了原有的出现漏洞的块链，最终是有惊无险地解决了这次比特币历史上最为重大的危机事件。

This means about just over 5hrs after it occurred a path was pushed to svn by satoshi.

5 hours is much more impressive than "within a day." even though the official release of 0.3.10 didn't occur until the next day. =/
